Turborepo's scaffolding cmd tool works with nextjs. But I wanted to create a simple strucuture of code-sharing which uses vite.
Here it is.

The components are in packages/ui/src/components  
The app which uses the components is at: apps/consumer-app  

The main depdency is defined at  apps/consumer-app/vite.config.ts - which can be extended.
